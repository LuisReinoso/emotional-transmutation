A web application that helps users transform their emotional states using the Hermetic Laws of Rhythm and Polarity. This tool provides suggestions and insights to transmute negative emotions into positive ones, based on the principle that everything flows between poles and follows a rhythmic motion.

## Demo
🌐 [Live Demo](https://luisreinoso.dev/emotional-transmutation)

## Hermetic Principles Applied

### Law of Polarity
Everything has two poles and can be transmuted from one pole to another. In emotions, this means that every negative state has its positive counterpart, and we can consciously move from one to the other.

### Law of Rhythm
All energy has a natural rhythm of ebb and flow. Understanding this principle allows us to consciously work with our emotional rhythms instead of being unconsciously controlled by them.

## Features
